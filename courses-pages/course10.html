            <h1 class="title">Prevention Against Virus Course</h1> <br>

            <p>
                Viruses are programs or parts of programs that are usually malicious, loaded onto your computer without
                your knowledge or permission,
                and spread by infecting, inserting copies of themselves, and becoming part of other computer programs
                and files.
                They are designed to destroy files or disrupt computer operations and can be distributed in various
                ways, such as through USB devices,
                emails, internet downloads, and computer networks. Once infected, a computer may experience a variety of
                issues, including slow performance,
                system crashes, data loss, and theft of personal information.
                Viruses rely on the execution of a host program or file to become active and start the infection
                process. Here are some common characteristics of viruses:
            </p> <br> <br> <br>

            <ul>
                <li>Self-executable: Viruses are self-executable programs. They often place their code in the execution
                    path
                    of other programs so that they run after the host program is started.</li>

                <li>Duplication: They can use the network to multiply, taking advantage of emails or shared resources on
                    local or internet networks.</li>

                <li>Stealthiness: Many viruses are designed to operate stealthily, without drawing attention from the
                    user
                    or operating system. They can hide in files or hard drives that are not easily detected.</li>

                <li>Destructiveness: Some viruses are designed to cause damage to data or systems, deleting files,
                    corrupting data, or rendering the system inoperable.</li>
            </ul> <br>

            <h2>Extension Virótica:</h2> <br>

            <p> Viral extensions are file extensions associated with files that contain malware, such as viruses,
                Trojans, ransomware, among others.
                Hackers often use these extensions to deceive users into opening malicious files, infecting their
                systems. Some examples of extensions:
            </p> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Executable files (.exe) are executable extensions used in Windows. They can be sent via email or
                    disguised as legitimate programs, such as cracked software versions, to deceive users and compromise
                    the
                    security of their systems.</li>

                <li>Compressed files (.zip and .rar) are also widely used in attacks. These extensions are applied for
                    data compression, requiring two clicks to view content. Thus, when the file is opened, the machine
                    ends
                    up being contaminated.</li>

                <li>Office files (.doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx) can be bait for cybercriminals, who insert malicious macros
                    in these files. Macros are small instructions executed within the file and can be used for malicious
                    activities. It is common to exchange emails within a company with these attachments, making them
                    attractive targets for criminals.</li>

                <li>PDF files, can contain malicious scripts that are activated when the file is opened. Also, PDF files
                    can contain phishing links that redirect users to fake websites designed to steal personal
                    information
                    or login credentials.</li>
            </ul> <br>

            <h2>Types of viruses:</h2> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>File viruses: Attach their code to executable files and spread when these files are opened or
                    executed.</li>

                <li>Boot viruses: Infect the boot sector of disks or storage units and are activated when the system is
                    booted from these devices.</li>

                <li>Trojan Horses (Trojans): They appear to be legitimate programs but are actually malicious. They can
                    open a port on infected systems so that hackers can access them remotely.</li>

                <li>Worms: Spread through networks, exploiting vulnerabilities in connected systems, without the need
                    for human interaction to spread.</li>

                <li>Ransomware: Encrypts files or systems and demands a ransom in exchange for the key to decrypt them.
                </li>

                <li>Spyware: Monitors user activities without their knowledge, collecting personal information and
                    transmitting it to third parties.</li>

                <li>Adware: Displays unwanted ads on infected devices, often causing system slowdown.</li>

                <li>Keyloggers: Record and transmit the keys typed by the user, allowing hackers to capture
                    confidential
                    information such as passwords and credit card numbers.</li>
            </ul> <br>

            <p>Prevention of viruses is essential to protect computers and devices against cyber threats. Here are some
                recommended practices to avoid virus infections:
            </p> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Antivirus Software: Install good antivirus and antimalware software and keep it updated. Configure
                    it to perform automatic scans regularly.</li>

                <li>Software Updates: Keep your operating system, web browsers, and other applications updated. Updates
                    often include important security fixes.</li>

                <li>Emails and Attachments: Be cautious when opening emails from unknown or suspicious senders. Avoid
                    clicking on links or downloading attachments from unsolicited emails.</li>

                <li>Safe Browsing: Avoid visiting unreliable and suspicious websites. Use a browser extension that can
                    help detect malicious sites.</li>

                <li>Firewall: Activate your computer's firewall to block unauthorized traffic and protect against
                    network threats.</li>

                <li>Data Backup: Regularly back up your important data and store it in a secure location. This can help
                    in recovery in case of a virus infection.</li>

                <li>Security Awareness Training: Conduct regular training sessions to teach employees about different
                    types of cyber threats, such as viruses, phishing, and ransomware.</li>
            </ul>
