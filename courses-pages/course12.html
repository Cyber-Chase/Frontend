            <h1 class="title">Wi-Fi Safe Usage Course</h1> <br>

            <p>
                Despite Wi-Fi being something accessible and common in people's daily lives, there are many risks that
                can go unnoticed.
                Using Wi-Fi offers many conveniences, but it also poses security risks that can compromise your personal
                data and privacy.
                Therefore, it is important to pay attention to some points when using Wi-Fi in order to avoid security
                issues.
            </p> <br> <br> <br>

            <h2>Data Theft:</h2> <br>
            <p>
                This is one of the biggest risks when using unsecured Wi-Fi. When you connect to an unprotected Wi-Fi
                network, your data can be
                intercepted by hackers who are on the same network. This includes confidential information such as
                passwords, credit card details,
                browsing history, and personal messages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example: When connecting to a public Wi-Fi network in a café, the user decides to access their bank
                account. A hacker who is also
                on the same network intercepts the data sent by the user, including their username and password. With
                this information, the hacker
                can access the user's bank account and carry out unauthorized transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
                To protect yourself against data theft, it is essential to use Wi-Fi networks protected by passwords
                whenever possible.
                Networks protected by security protocols like WPA2 or WPA3 are harder to breach. Additionally, avoid
                entering confidential
                information on unsecured websites and keep your devices and applications updated to fix any known
                vulnerabilities.
            </p> <br>

            <h2>Identity Theft:</h2> <br>
            <p>
                Identity theft occurs when hackers gain access to enough personal information to impersonate you. This
                may include data such
                as your full name, date of birth, social security number, address, and other personal information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example: The user is at the airport and connects to the public Wi-Fi network offered in the terminal. A
                hacker who is on the
                same network manages to capture personal information from the user, such as their full name, email
                address, and phone number,
                while they browse the internet. With this information, the hacker can easily steal the user's identity
                and commit fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
                To protect yourself against identity
                theft when using Wi-Fi, avoid providing confidential personal information on public networks.
                Additionally, consider using a
                VPN to encrypt your connection and protect your data from interception by third parties.
            </p> <br>

            <h2>Malware and Phishing Attacks:</h2> <br>
            <p>
                Unsecured Wi-Fi networks are often targeted by malware and phishing attacks. Hackers can use these
                networks to distribute malware
                to connected devices or send phishing emails designed to deceive users and steal their information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example: The user receives an email while connected to the Wi-Fi network in their hotel, informing them
                that their bank account
                has been compromised and requesting them to click on a link to "fix" the issue. The link actually leads
                to a fake website designed
                to steal the user's banking credentials or install malware on their device.
            </p>
            <p>
                To protect yourself against malware and phishing, ensure that all devices
                you use to connect to the internet have up-to-date antivirus and antimalware software. Additionally, be
                cautious when clicking on
                links in emails or text messages, especially if they are from unknown senders.

            <h2>Espionage and Monitoring:</h2> <br>
            <p>
                In unsecured Wi-Fi networks, hackers can monitor your online activity, including websites you visit,
                messages you send and receive,
                and any other information transmitted over the network.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example: The user is at an airport using the public Wi-Fi network to send confidential business emails.
                A hacker who is on the
                same network can use monitoring tools to intercept their emails and obtain confidential information
                about their business.
            </p>
            <p>
                To protect yourself against espionage and monitoring, avoid conducting sensitive
                activities such as financial transactions or accessing online accounts on unsecured public Wi-Fi
                networks. Additionally, consider
                using a VPN to encrypt your internet traffic and protect your privacy.
            </p> <br>

            <h2>Spoofing Attacks:</h2> <br>
            <p>
                Spoofing occurs when hackers create fake Wi-Fi networks with names similar to legitimate ones to deceive
                users and steal their data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example: The user is at an airport and sees two available Wi-Fi networks: "Airport Wi-Fi" and "Free
                Airport Wi-Fi." They connect to
                the second option, thinking it is the free network offered by the airport, but it is actually a fake
                network created by a hacker
                to capture their data.
            </p>
            <p>
                To protect yourself against spoofing attacks, always carefully check the name and security of the Wi-Fi
                network before connecting. Avoid connecting to networks that appear suspicious or do not require a
                password for access. If in
                doubt, ask the personnel responsible for the network, such as café or hotel staff, about the correct
                Wi-Fi network.
            </p> <br>

            <h2>Valuable tips for using Wi-Fi securely:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not join unfamiliar networks.</li>
                <li>Disable the option to automatically connect to networks to prevent unintentional connection to
                    public, password-less networks.</li>
                <li>Use a VPN, which encrypts data and hides your real IP address, enhancing your connection security.
                </li>
                <li>Avoid logging into any network or service or conducting banking transactions when connected to an
                    unknown Wi-Fi</li>
                <li>Always log out after using an unfamiliar network.</li>
                <li>Enable multi-factor authentication (to learn more, click here and take the Cyber Chase Multi-Factor
                    Authentication Course!).</li>
            </ul>
