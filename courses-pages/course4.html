            <h1 class="course-title">Firewall Course</h1> <br>

            <p id="course-description"> A firewall is like a digital security guard for your computer or network.
                It acts as a barrier between your private network (like your personal computer
                or a corporate network) and the internet,
                helping to protect against threats and malicious attacks.
            </p>

            <h2 class="course-subtitle">Types of Firewalls:</h2>

            <h3 class="course-topic">Hardware Firewall:</h3>
            <p> This type of firewall is a physical device placed between your local
                network and the internet. It analyzes incoming and outgoing network traffic,
                blocking or allowing access based on predefined security rules.
            </p>

            <h3 class="course-topic">Software Firewall:</h3>
            <p> A software firewall is a program installed on a device,
                such as a computer or server. It monitors network traffic and applies
                security rules to filter and block unwanted data packets.
            </p> <br>

            <h2 class="course-subtitle">What are the main functions of a Firewall?</h2>
            <p> The primary function of a firewall is to protect a computer network
                or an individual device (like a computer or smartphone) against cyber threats.
                The firewall acts as a security barrier between your private network and the internet,
                monitoring and controlling data traffic entering and leaving. <br>
                Here are some of the main functions of a firewall:
            </p> <br>

            <h3 class="course-topic">Packet Filtering</h3>
            <p> The firewall examines data packets traveling through the network based on predefined
                security rules. It decides whether to allow or block these packets based on criteria
                such as IP addresses, communication ports, protocol types, among others.
            </p> <br>

            <h3 class="course-topic">Access Control:</h3>
            <p> The firewall can restrict access to certain network services or resources,
                allowing only authorized connections. This helps prevent external attackers
                from accessing unauthorized internal systems.
            </p>

            <h3 class="course-topic">Intrusion Prevention:</h3>
            <p> Some firewalls are capable of identifying and blocking suspicious activities that
                may indicate intrusion attempts or cyber attacks, such as port scans or malicious traffic.
            </p> <br>

            <h3 class="course-topic">Malware Protection:</h3>
            <p> The firewall can block access to sites known for distributing malware
                or prevent malicious programs from communicating with remote servers.
            </p> <br>

            <h3 class="course-topic">Traffic Monitoring:</h3>
            <p> The firewall logs and monitors network traffic, providing insights into activity patterns
                and potential threats. This helps network administrators identify and respond to security incidents.
            </p> <br>

            <h3 class="course-topic">Layered Security:</h2>
            <p> Firewalls are a fundamental part of a layered security strategy.
                Combined with other security measures such as antivirus, intrusion detection,
                and behavior analysis, firewalls help protect networks against a variety of threats.
            </p> <br>

            <h3 class="course-topic">NAT (Network Address Translation):</h3>
            <p> Converting private IP addresses to public IP addresses and vice versa,
                thus protecting the identity of the internal network.
            </p> <br>

            <h3 class="course-topic">Stateful Inspection:</h3>
            <p> Monitoring the state of network connections and allowing only traffic that is part
                of a legitimate connection.
            </p> <br>

            <h3 class="course-topic">Port Blocking:</h3>
            <p> Controlling which network ports can be used for communication,
                helping to block malicious activities.
            </p> <br>

            <p> In summary, a firewall plays an essential role in protecting against cyber threats,
                controlling network traffic, and implementing security policies to ensure the integrity,
                confidentiality, and availability of systems and data.
            </p>
