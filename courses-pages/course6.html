            <h1>Prevention Against Phishing Course</h1> <br>

            <h2>
                Phishing is a form of online fraud that relies on psychological manipulation to deceive people and
                obtain confidential
                information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data. Scammers often impersonate
                trusted entities such as
                banks, well-known companies, or internet services, and send fraudulent messages via email, text
                messages, social media, or
                even phone calls.
            </h2> <br><br><br>

            <h2>What is Phishing and How it works</h2> <br>
            <h3>
                The term "phishing" comes from "fishing," suggesting the idea of fishing for personal information.
                Criminals use social
                engineering techniques to persuade victims to disclose confidential information or click on malicious
                links.
            </h3><br>

            <h2>Phishing Methods: Scammers use a variety of methods, including:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Phishing Emails: Fake emails that appear legitimate, requesting personal information such as
                    passwords or credit card
                    numbers.</li>
                <li>Phishing via SMS (Smishing): Fraudulent text messages that attempt to trick users into providing
                    personal information or
                    clicking on malicious links.</li>
                <li>Phishing via Phone (Vishing): Phone calls where scammers pose as representatives of companies,
                    banks, or government agencies
                    to obtain personal information.</li>
            </ul> <br><br>

            <h2>How to identify Phishing</h2> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Attention to Detail: Pay attention to grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and improper formatting
                    in emails. Legitimate
                    companies typically have well-written and reviewed communications.</li>
                <li>Source Verification: Always verify the sender's email address or phone number. If you don't
                    recognize the sender or if the
                    communication seems suspicious, be cautious.</li>
                <li>Beware of Suspicious URLs: Before clicking on a link, hover over it (without clicking) to see the
                    actual URL address. If it
                    looks strange or suspicious, don't click.</li>
                <li>Analyze Message Content: Be aware of messages that request personal or financial information, demand
                    immediate action, or
                    create a sense of urgency, specially messages that were not expected. These are common phishing
                    tactics.</li>
            </ul><br><br>

            <h2>How to Prevent from Phishing</h2> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep Software and Antivirus Updated: Keep your operating system, browser, and antivirus software up to date to protect 
                    against known vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li>Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible to add an extra layer of security 
                    to your accounts.</li>
                <li>Educate Yourself and Others: Stay informed about the latest phishing techniques and share this knowledge with friends, 
                    family, and colleagues. Remind them to be cautious when dealing with suspicious messages.</li>
                <li>Use Security Tools: Consider using security tools such as spam filters and phishing blockers to help protect your 
                    email inbox.</li>
                <li>Double-Check: Always verify requests for personal or financial information with a trusted alternative source. 
                    For example, if you receive an email from a bank requesting information, contact the bank directly to verify the 
                    authenticity of the request.</li>
            </ul><br><br>

            <h2>
                Now that you have learned what is and how to protect yourself against Phishing methods, always remember to stay vigilant and 
                question the authenticity of any online communication that seems suspicious. By adopting proactive cybersecurity measures and 
                educating others about the dangers of phishing, we can help protect our personal and financial information against cyberattacks.
