            <h1 class="course-title">Prevention Against Phishing Course</h1> <br>

            <p id="course-description"> Phishing is a form of online fraud that relies on psychological manipulation to
                deceive people and
                obtain confidential information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data.
                Scammers often impersonate trusted entities such as
                banks, well-known companies, or internet services, and send fraudulent messages via email, text
                messages, social media, or even phone calls.
            </p>

            <h2 class="course-subtitle">What is Phishing? How it works?</h2> <br>
            <p> The term "phishing" comes from "fishing," suggesting the idea of fishing for personal information.
                Criminals use social engineering techniques to persuade victims to disclose confidential information or
                click on malicious links.
            </p> <br>

            <h3 class="course-topic">Phishing Methods: Scammers use a variety of methods, including:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Phishing Emails: Fake emails that appear legitimate, requesting personal information such as
                    passwords or credit card numbers.</li>

                <li>Phishing via SMS (Smishing): Fraudulent text messages that attempt to trick users into providing
                    personal information or clicking on malicious links.</li>

                <li>Phishing via Phone (Vishing): Phone calls where scammers pose as representatives of companies,
                    banks, or government agencies to obtain personal information.</li>

                <li>Spear Phishing: Spear phishing is a targeted form of phishing attack where attackers customize their
                    messages to specific individuals or organizations. Unlike regular phishing, which casts a wide net
                    hoping to
                    catch any victims, spear phishing is more tailored and often appears to come from a trusted or known
                    source.
                    Attackers gather information about their targets from various sources such as social media, company
                    websites,
                    or previous data breaches to craft convincing emails. These emails often contain malicious links or
                    attachments
                    designed to steal sensitive information or install malware on the victim's system.</li>

                <li>Whaling: Whaling is a type of phishing attack that specifically targets high-profile individuals
                    within an organization,
                    such as executives or top-level management. The term "whaling" is derived from the analogy of these
                    individuals being
                    "big fish" in the corporate sea. Attackers aim to deceive these key figures into divulging sensitive
                    information,
                    transferring funds, or granting access to confidential systems. Whaling attacks often involve
                    sophisticated social
                    engineering techniques and may use information gleaned from publicly available sources to craft
                    convincing and personalized
                    messages.</li>

                <li>Scams: Scams encompass a wide range of fraudulent schemes designed to deceive individuals or
                    organizations for financial
                    gain. These can include email scams, phone scams, online shopping scams, investment scams, and many
                    others. Scammers
                    often employ persuasive tactics, false promises, or fear-inducing messages to manipulate their
                    victims into providing
                    money, personal information, or access to their assets. With the rise of digital communication and
                    online transactions,
                    scams have become increasingly sophisticated, making it essential for individuals and businesses to
                    remain vigilant and
                    educate themselves about common scam tactics.</li>
            </ul> <br>

            <h2 class="course-subtitle">How to Identify Phishing</h2> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Attention to Detail: Pay attention to grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and improper formatting
                    in emails.
                    Legitimate companies typically have well-written and reviewed communications.</li>

                <li>Source Verification: Always verify the sender's email address or phone number, specially senders
                    with
                    whom you have no relashionship.
                    If you don't recognize the sender or if the communication seems suspicious, be cautious.</li>

                <li>Beware of Suspicious URLs: Before clicking on a link, hover over it (without clicking) to see the
                    actual URL address and pay attention to minimum details, such as different letters. An example is
                    the difference
                    between the "a"(latin alphabet) and the "Î±"(greek alphabet), which is very used in fake links.</li>

                <li>Analyze Message Content: Be aware of messages that request personal or financial information, demand
                    immediate action, or create a sense of urgency, specially messages that were not expected, besides
                    of messages
                    with something too good to be true. In these cases, attachments are also suspicious.
                    These are common phishing tactics.</li>
            </ul> <br>

            <h2 class="course-subtitle">How to Prevent from Phishing</h2> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep Software and Antivirus Updated: Keep your operating system, browser, and antivirus software up
                    to date to protect
                    against known vulnerabilities.</li>

                <li>Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible to add an
                    extra layer of security
                    to your accounts.</li>

                <li>Educate Yourself and Others: Stay informed about the latest phishing techniques and share this
                    knowledge with friends,
                    family, and colleagues. Remind them to be cautious when dealing with suspicious messages.</li>
                <li>Use Security Tools: Consider using security tools such as spam filters and phishing blockers to help
                    protect your
                    email inbox.</li>

                <li>Double-Check: Always verify requests for personal or financial information with a trusted
                    alternative source.
                    For example, if you receive an email from a bank requesting information, contact the bank directly
                    to verify the
                    authenticity of the request.</li>
            </ul> <br>

            <p>
                Now that you have learned what is and how to protect yourself against Phishing methods, always remember
                to stay vigilant and
                question the authenticity of any online communication that seems suspicious. By adopting proactive
                cybersecurity measures and
                educating others about the dangers of phishing, we can help protect our personal and financial
                information against cyberattacks.
