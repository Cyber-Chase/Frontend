            <p id="course-description">
                An antivirus is a software designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software,
                such as viruses, worms, trojans, adware, and spyware, from a computer or computer system.</p>
            <p id="course-description">
                They work by scanning files for suspicious code patterns that may indicate the presence of malware.</p>
            <p id="course-description">
                When the antivirus identifies malware, it can remove or quarantine the infected file,
                preventing the malicious software from spreading and causing further damage to the system.</p>
            <p id="course-description">Additionally, antiviruses can also offer real-time protection by continuously
                monitoring suspicious
                activities on the system to prevent infections.</p>

            <h3 class="course-topic">Important Tips:</h3> <br>
            <p> There are several tools available to search for and remove viruses from your system, but prevention is
                still the best strategy. <br>
                It is recommended to follow these practices:
            </p> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Always keep your antivirus program updated.</li>
                <li>Avoid using pirated programs.</li>
                <li>Before installing a new program, research it to verify if it is safe and virus-free; if you find any
                    viruses, remove them.</li>
                <li>Protect your storage devices (pendrives, external hard drives, CDs, DVDs, etc.) against unauthorized
                    recordings, avoiding their use on unknown computers that may be infected.</li>
                <li>Regularly back up your files so you can recover them in case of a virus attack or disk damage.
                <li>Control access to your system by unauthorized people.</li>
                <li>Check your equipment after installing new programs/systems or after interventions by technical
                    support.</li>
                <li>If possible, keep an antivirus program running in the background while using the computer to detect
                    and intervene if any virus manifests.</li>
            </ul>
