            <h1>Antivirus Course</h1> <br>

            <p> An antivirus is a software designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software,
                such as viruses, worms, trojans, adware, and spyware, from a computer or computer system.
                They work by scanning files for suspicious code patterns that may indicate the presence of malware.
                When the antivirus identifies malware, it can remove or quarantine the infected file,
                preventing the malicious software from spreading and causing further damage to the system.
                Additionally, antiviruses can also offer real-time protection by continuously monitoring suspicious
                activities on the system to prevent infections.

            <h2>Important Tips:</h2> <br>
            <p> There are several tools available to search for and remove viruses from your system, but prevention is
                still the best strategy. <br>
                It is recommended to follow these practices:
            </p> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Always keep your antivirus program updated.</li>
                <li>Avoid using pirated programs.</li>
                <li>Before installing a new program, research it to verify if it is safe and virus-free; if you find any
                    viruses, remove them.</li>
                <li>Protect your storage devices (pendrives, external hard drives, CDs, DVDs, etc.) against unauthorized
                    recordings, avoiding their use on unknown computers that may be infected.</li>
                <li>Regularly back up your files so you can recover them in case of a virus attack or disk damage.
                <li>Control access to your system by unauthorized people.</li>
                <li>Check your equipment after installing new programs/systems or after interventions by technical
                    support.</li>
                <li>If possible, keep an antivirus program running in the background while using the computer to detect
                    and intervene if any virus manifests.</li>
